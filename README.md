# This is my formula one project

### About my project
My website is about formula 1. It shows details on the teams, drivers, cars, and answers basic questions for people new to formlua one.

### The design
* Colour
  * For the titles on the home page I used bright red because red is the main colour of F1.
  * For the language change button I chose red and black because those are the traditional maori colours.
  * For the header and footer for all of the pages i used a dark red because red is the coulour of F1 and that was a more subtle tone as to not draw too much attention.
  * For the page change buttons I once again used a lighter red for the same reason.
  * For the header texts I used red once again because once again it is the main colour of F1.
  * For the subtext title I chose orange because it is similar to red and the colour of F1 mclarn team.
  * For the questions page I chose those backround colours because they where not too harsh.
  * For the main header text on the teams pages I ised the teams main colour
  * For the subtext title on the teams pages I used the teams second main colour
  * For the buttons on the teams page I used the teams lightest and darkest colours in thier pallet (usually just black and white)
  

* Layout
 * This is the layout of the home page
